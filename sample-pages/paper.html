Workforce staffing and assignment decisions are of critical importance for meeting the challenge of minimizing
operational costs while providing satisfactory customer service. These decisions are particularly challenging for
omnichannel service centers, where customers can request services via different communication channels
(e.g., phone, e-mail, live-chat, social media) that have different service quality and response requirements. We
present a formulation of the omnichannel workforce management problem that accounts for variations in response urgencies of different channels as well as diminishing agent performances due to channel switching.
We develop an algorithm that efficiently provides solutions for this problem and determines the number and
channel allocation of service agents within the service center. Through numerical experiments, we study the performance of the algorithm among various service center configurations with equal cost characteristics. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm can identify service center structures that outperform many
alternative structures, including those commonly-adopted in the real-world.

1. Introduction
Organizations all around the globe are increasingly relying on new
digital communication mediums (e.g., social media, live-chat, e-mail)
to connect with their customers. Widespread adoption of these technologies has lowered the communication barriers between customers and
organizations, leading to a surge in the number of customer inquiries
that organizations need to resolve every day [1]. Today's tech savvy customers do not only make phone calls, but also “live-chat”, “e-mail”,
“tweet”, “text”, “Facebook post”, “use online forums”, etc. to request services and to convey their messages.
Unsurprisingly, many organizations are moving away from a traditional (i.e., phone based) call center model to omnichannel service centers. Omnichannel service centers provide greater customer loyalty
and higher satisfaction by providing services through multiple digital
mediums at customers' convenience [2]. Forrester Research [3] reports
significant growth (15% - 20%) in the use of digital channels such as
live-chat and online forums among service center customers between
2012 and 2014. According to Cisco [4], omnichannel service is one of
the top three trends that emerged in customer relationship management. Newer service center platforms such as SAP's Hybris Service Engagement Center1 allow firms to provide ticketing and support
services through multiple channels, while enabling their agents to
move across these channels seamlessly.
For all their potential benefits in improving customer relations,
omnichannel service centers bring additional operational challenges
for firms. Industry surveys indicate that one of the major challenges in
omnichannel service center management is agent workforce management [5]. Allocating and assigning service agents across multiple channels with different skill requirements (e.g., talking over the phone, textbased messaging, social media monitoring) can be a complex task, especially when the service demands coming through different channels
vary. Ideally, a firm could prefer to keep their best agents available on
channels where they feel most comfortable. However, a high degree of
specialization may lead to excessive hiring costs as well as inefficiency
due to idle work times. The other end of this spectrum would be to
allow service agents to dynamically move across all available channels.
Undoubtedly, this approach also comes with downsides, including excessive training costs, diminishing agent performance due to cognitive
limitations [6,7] and loss of quality due to lack of gaining specialized
skill experience [8]. Workforce management is further complicated by
the fact that it may be more preferable for the firm to delay certain service requests for the sake of others (e.g., delaying e-mail responses until
the phone channel becomes idle).
Under this situation, identifying ideal service center structures that
minimize overall operating costs while ensuring satisfactory customer
service across multiple channels becomes an important problem for
omnichannel service centers. Our study aims to address this problem.

In particular, we propose a novel method for solving the staff planning
problem in an omnichannel service setting, in which different service
channels may have different response urgencies. Staff planning is one
of three main problems within the workforce management domain [9,
10]. The goal of this problem is to determine the long-term strategic
staffing levels (hiring and training) for a planning period (e.g., year),
while considering a cost-based objective function and performance-related constraints. Such staffing decisions are usually made several
weeks and sometimes months ahead of time due to lead times associated with hiring and training employees [11]. From a managerial standpoint, our method addresses the following three questions regarding
staff planning:
1) How many service agents should be employed within an
omnichannel service center?
2) To which channel(s) should each service agent be assigned?
The first research question is concerned with determining the total
number of agents needed in the service center for the entirety of the
planning period whereas the second research question considers identifying the constant channel assignment of each agent. It is important
to note that answering these questions requires considering the tradeoff between staffing costs (hiring and training) and penalty costs due
to service delays. Our method incorporates this trade-off in the solution,
as well as various other omnichannel considerations such as
diminishing agent performances due to channel switching and variations in response urgencies of different channels.
There are three main motivating factors that distinguish our study
from earlier work in the workforce management literature. First, we
specify our problem within the context of omniservice service centers
that have several unique routing and staffing considerations such as a
hierarchical order among channels and diminishing agent performances. In particular, the first issue (response priority differences
among channels) requires us to solve a routing problem at the realization of each time interval, in addition to the master staffing problem.
To our knowledge, Wallace and Whitt [12] is the only study that considered solving routing and staffing problems concurrently, however their
approach depends on a static priority-routing scheme in addition to
having constraints on service agent skill sets. Our approach relaxes
both of these assumptions. Second, we capture the trade-off between
staffing costs and service quality by explicitly incorporating the quality
related costs into the optimization model. A number of previous studies
have used external simulation models to estimate service levels, which
are used as optimization constraints at each iteration of the solution
process. However, this approach is less satisfactory for instances
where it may be impractical, or even impossible, to simulate the system.
In addition, we believe that representing service quality (i.e., service
shortage) as a penalty cost is a natural way of quantifying the outcomes
by firm managers and decision makers. Third, our approach aims to simultaneously fulfill two distinct but interconnected goals: determining
staff levels and determining staff flexibility. To our knowledge, there is
little research that attempted to satisfy these two goals collectively in
the omnichannel service center setting. Further, a majority of previous
studies in the literature have focused on only one of these issues,
while keeping other variables and outcomes constant. Yet, from a management (practical) standpoint, there is no inherent reason to pre-determine or set any values when the single overall goal of the firm is to
minimize total operating and service delay costs, as shown in Aksin et
al. [13]. We believe that the comprehensiveness of our approach
makes it highly practical and applicable to real-world omnichannel service centers.
We evaluate the performance of our approach using numerical experiments that mimic possible different scenarios in an omnichannel
service center. To assess the performance of the proposed solution, we
develop a discrete-event simulation program and compute the waiting
times and overall service levels under a variety of system parameters.
The results indicate that the proposed method can identify service center structures that outperform many competitive structures, including
several commonly adopted in the real-world.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review
the related literature. In Section 3, we present the model formulations
and describe our solution algorithm. In Section 4, we run numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Finally, in
Section 5, we conclude the paper with a discussion of the findings, limitations, and potential future work.
2. Related literature
There exists a large body of literature that addresses workforce problems in service centers. Our study draws from two main research
streams within this context. The first stream focuses on determining
flexibility levels for employees that can be cross-utilized in different
skills. It has been widely known that cross-utilization of employees
among departments with varying service demand is a well-recognized
policy for coping with service shortages [14,15]. Jordan and Graves
[16] was one of the earlier works that showed that certain flexibility
configurations can achieve almost all the benefits of full server flexibility. They introduced the concept of chaining (in the context of
manufacturing), which is a special structure that connects, directly or
indirectly, all demand and all server nodes in the system via flexibility
links. Brusco and Johns [17] and Hopp et al. [18] extended the idea of
chaining to cross-training of employees in service operations. On the
other hand, Gurumurthi and Benjaafar [19] showed that chained configurations may not always be the best solution, especially when asymmetric systems are considered. Under this consideration, Iravani et al.
[20,21] developed performance indices to compare and rank pre-defined service flexibility structures. These indices characterize the ability
of cross-training structures (such as cross-trained call center employees) to respond effectively to variability in demand. More recently,
Aksin et al. [13] compared different flexibility structures including twoskill chain, adjacent-level [22], nested, and overflow from a profit maximization perspective. They particularly focused on the value of flexibility under each structure after optimizing the server capacity levels (as
opposed to considering fixed capacity levels). Besides the evaluation
of pre-defined cross-training structures, there is also research on identification of good cross-training structures. Notable work in this area was
conducted by Chou et al. [23], who adopted the concept of graph expansion to analyze worst-case performances in general demand settings
and suggested heuristics based on the results for designing flexible process structures. Another contribution was provided by Andradόttir et al.
[24], who used the notion of bottlenecks in heterogeneous systems to
identify certain characteristics of desirable flexibility structures. Also
relevant to this stream is the work of Bassamboo et al. [22], who investigated optimal flexibility configurations within newsvendor network
models.
A majority of these existing studies consider staffing levels to be constant for flexibility analysis. On the other hand, there exists a separate
research stream in the literature that particularly focuses on determining staffing levels. For example, Cezik and L'Ecuyer [25] proposed an algorithm to minimize the staffing costs of a multiskill service center
subject to service-level requirements. A particular strength of their
work is differentiating server pools in terms of skill preferences. However, their approach suffered from long computation times due to the
need of simulating the system at each iteration of the algorithm, and
this issue was explicitly addressed by Pot et al. [26] via a heuristic algorithm that avoided simulations. While these two studies primarily investigated optimal staffing allocation that is constant over a longer
term period, a different body of work focused on staffing decisions
over shorter term schedules. For example, Harrison and Zeevi [27] developed a novel method for sizing server pools that are only fixed within
shorter planning periods, such as multiple shifts within 1 day. Similarly,
Atlason et al. [28] suggested a method to find approximately optimal
